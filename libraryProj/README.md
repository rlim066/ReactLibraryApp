# Library App

This project was created as a basic Library Management App with features such as adding books and more (to come..)

## Instructions for Setup

Setup all dependencies as stated in the package.json file

### IMPORTANT SETUP NOTE
Use React Router DOM v5.2.0 & REMOVE React Strict Mode from index.js to prevent routing issues
This has already been done by default but this is incase there is issues with your app.

### Start Up a jsonServer on port 8000
run npx json-server --watch src/data.json --port 8000 

### run `npm start` in the libraryProj directory 
The server is expected to run on port 3000 by default
